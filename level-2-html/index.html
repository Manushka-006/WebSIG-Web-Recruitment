        <h4><u>Robotics</u></h4>
        <p>Robotics is the interdisciplinary field of science and engineering dedicated to creating machines, called robots, that can perceive their environment, process information, and perform physical tasks. While Knowledge Engineering provides the logic and Machine Learning provides the ability to learn from data, Robotics provides the "body" that allows AI to interact with the physical world. Every robot is defined by the integration of three core systems: mechanics (the physical structure and joints), electronics (the sensors and power supply), and computation (the "brain" or software that translates data into action). By using actuators to move and sensors like cameras or LiDAR to "see," robots can perform tasks ranging from repetitive assembly line work to complex, high-stakes operations like deep-sea exploration or robotic surgery.</p>
        <h4><u>Machine Learning</u></h4>
        <p>Machine Learning (ML) is a subfield of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. While Knowledge Engineering relies on humans providing specific rules, ML uses mathematical algorithms and statistical models to analyze vast amounts of data, identifying underlying patterns and making predictions or decisions based on that information. By processing examples—such as thousands of images or lines of text—the system refines its own internal logic over time, allowing it to handle complex tasks like speech recognition, autonomous driving, and personalized recommendations that are often too intricate for manual rule-writing.</p>
        <h4><u>Knowledge Engineering</u></h4>
        <p>Knowledge engineering is essentially the process of "teaching" a computer how to think like a specialist by turning human expertise into clear, logical rules. Imagine trying to explain your grandmother's secret recipe to a robot: you can't just say "add a pinch of love"—you have to translate that intuition into exact grams, temperatures, and timings. In the same way, knowledge engineers work with experts like doctors or financial analysts to extract their "rules of thumb" and structure them into a knowledge base that a machine can follow. Unlike some modern AI that makes statistical guesses based on huge amounts of data, knowledge engineering creates expert systems that can actually explain their reasoning, making them incredibly valuable in high-stakes fields like medicine or law where understanding the "why" behind a decision is just as important as the decision itself.</p>
        <h4><u>Natural Language Processing</u></h4>
        <p>Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the branch of artificial intelligence that allows computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a way that is both meaningful and useful. While machines are naturally programmed for rigid code, NLP bridges the gap by using computational linguistics and machine learning to process the nuances of "natural" speech and text—including slang, sarcasm, and complex grammar. The process is generally divided into two main components: Natural Language Understanding (NLU), which focuses on deciphering intent and meaning from unstructured input, and Natural Language Generation (NLG), which allows the machine to respond by constructing coherent, human-like sentences.</p>
