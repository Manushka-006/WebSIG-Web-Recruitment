What HTML does? HTML-Hypertext Markup Language:It is used to creat web pages.It act as the skeleton of webpage that structures different contents like text,image,video and link using tags. Difference Between div and semantic tags. Sementaic tags improves the readablity of the code,it clearly describes the content they contain to browser and developer. Div is a non semantic tag which does not describe the content it contains. The most confused part was: First I did not get the correct idea of the semantic tags,I got confused because, I did not understand where it makes the change So I refered some youtube videos to learn about and got the the correct idea.
