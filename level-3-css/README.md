What is Flex box?
It is a layout used to arrange things in rows or colums to make the website more arranged.
Why CSS is hard?
The main issue I faced was it has many context to be learned  like styling spacing flexbox So it takes time to learn all the things.
One thing that finally "clicked"
I understood basic things of styling the website
But faced difficuties in doing the flexbox.
